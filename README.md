This repo contains links to the deep learning models we used in our forthcoming publication.

If you are only interested in visualizing the neural network architecture we used for **classification**, download the model [here](https://cloud.parisdescartes.fr/index.php/s/wWzdgGzm47pks7J) in ONNX format, and open it with the freely available [Neutron visualizer](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron).

If you are only interested in visualizing the neural network architecture we used for **semantic segmentation**, download the model [here](https://cloud.parisdescartes.fr/index.php/s/AJJyJZLWPiSci3T) in ONNX formant, and open it with the freely available [Neutron visualizer](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron).
